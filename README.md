# git_war_game

This project was mainly to explore the steps involved with creating a "choose your adventure" game.  The main skills used for this project were flow management and pyinstaller in order to bundle the program into a small, universally accessible executable file for anyone to use.

Although the first interface is only through the use of the command window, I may update this project to leverage tkinter or PyQT5 in order to interface through a more aesthetic, customized GUI with buttons, text entry, and storyline window.
